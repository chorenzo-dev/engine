State Management:

After successfully completing the recipe application for this project, you MUST update the state.json file located at {{ workspace_root }}/.chorenzo/state.json to track what this recipe provides.

1. Read the current state.json file (create it if it doesn't exist with {})
2. Add/update keys under `projects.{{ project_relative_path }}`:
   {{ recipe_provides }}

   Set appropriate values for each key based on what you actually accomplished during the recipe execution for this specific project.

   IMPORTANT: Do NOT add any entries to the "workspace" section - this is a project-level recipe and should ONLY update the "projects" section.

3. Write the updated state back to state.json with keys in alphabetical order

Example structure:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "{{ project_relative_path }}": {
      "{{ recipe_id }}.configured": true
    }
  }
}
```
