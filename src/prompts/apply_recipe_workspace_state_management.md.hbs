State Management:

After successfully completing the recipe application, you MUST update the state.json file located at {{ workspace_root }}/.chorenzo/state.json to track what this recipe provides.

1. Read the current state.json file (create it if it doesn't exist with {})
2. Add/update the following keys under the "workspace" field:
   {{ recipe_provides }}

   Set appropriate values for each key based on what you actually accomplished during the recipe execution.

   IMPORTANT: Do NOT add any entries to the "projects" section - this is a workspace-level recipe and should ONLY update the "workspace" section.

3. Write the updated state back to state.json with keys in alphabetical order

Example structure:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "frontend": {
      "other-recipe.configured": true
    }
  },
  "workspace": {
    "{{ recipe_id }}.configured": true
  }
}
```
