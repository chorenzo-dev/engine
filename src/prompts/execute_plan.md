Please execute the following YAML plan:

{{ plan_content }}

The plan is structured as YAML with steps to execute. For each step:
1. Execute commands in the "commands" array using Bash
2. Create/modify files specified in the "files" array
3. Follow the execution order exactly

Important:
- If any step fails, stop and report the error
- Track all changes made for the execution log
- The "outputs" section defines expected results that should be achieved

After completing all steps, respond with:
1. A summary of what was accomplished
2. Confirmation that all outputs were achieved
3. Any warnings or issues encountered
