Follow these guidelines for creating the recipe:
{{ recipe_guidelines }}

**ECOSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:**

- Use ONLY `javascript` or `python` as ecosystem IDs
- An ecosystem refers to the language runtime environment, NOT specific technologies
- ✅ `javascript` includes: TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vue, Angular, etc.
- ✅ `python` includes: Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.

**VARIANT CREATION RULES:**

- CRITICAL: When you detect multiple tools/approaches in your fix instructions, you MUST create separate variants
- Each distinct tool or approach gets its own variant with its own fix file
- Good variants: Different tools that accomplish the same goal through different approaches
- Bad variants: Minor configuration differences within the same tool, different versions of the same tool, cosmetic naming differences
- If only one approach exists, use single 'default' variant
- If you find yourself writing "For Tool A do X, for Tool B do Y" in a single fix file, create separate variants instead

**PROVIDES/REQUIRES GUIDELINES:**

- Create meaningful, specific output names instead of generic ones
- Good: `formatting.prettier-configured`, `linting.eslint-setup`
- Bad: `recipe-name.configured`, `recipe-name.applied`
- Only reference existing recipe outputs in requires field
- Available outputs: {{ available_outputs }}

**INSTRUCTION WRITING RULES:**

- Keep instructions generic and ecosystem-agnostic in prompt.md
- Use specific tools as examples only: "e.g., Prettier for JavaScript, Black for Python"
- Focus on concepts and investigation steps, not tool-specific implementation
- Avoid tool-specific checks unless recipe specifically targets that tool
- Write investigation steps that work across different implementations

**CODE SNIPPET RULES:**

- Avoid basic code examples (imports, simple function calls)
- Only include complex configuration examples when absolutely necessary
- Focus on configuration files and setup commands
- Let developers implement the actual code
- Prefer describing what to configure rather than showing trivial code

**FILE STRUCTURE:**

1. Create {{ recipe_path }}/metadata.yaml with:
   - Meaningful provides/requires lists
   - Separate variants for each tool/approach you identified
2. Create {{ recipe_path }}/prompt.md with:
   - Generic investigation steps
   - Ecosystem-agnostic guidance
3. Create {{ recipe_path }}/fixes/[ecosystem]\_[variant].md with:
   - ONE tool/approach per fix file
   - Specific implementation for that ecosystem and variant
   - Minimal, essential code examples only
   - If multiple tools exist, create multiple fix files

Use the Write tool to create each file following these principles.
